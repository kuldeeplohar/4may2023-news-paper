        <img src="./img/1.png">
        <p>Virat Kohli has fired a fresh warning to Rohit Sharma and Co. before the ICC World Test Championship final between India and Australia at The Oval.India's Virat Kohli gestures during a training session at The Oval(AP) </p>
        <p>After being upstaged by the Black Caps in the inaugural edition of the ICC World Test Championship, the onus is on run-machine Virat Kohli to make amends and deliver the goods with the bat in India's second straight final of the showpiece event. Last season's runners-up India led by Rohit Sharma will cross swords with Pat Cummins' Australia in the final of the ICC World Test Championship at The Oval on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>One of the most successful leaders in the longest format, Kohli guided India to the first-ever final of the World Test Championship back in 2021. However, Kohli and Co. failed to end India's trophy drought in ICC events as the Asian giants were outclassed by Kane Williamson’s New Zealand in the rain-marred final at Southampton. Taking up the role of a pure batter after relinquishing the Test captaincy, Kohli has regained top form in the second edition of the Test Championship.</p>

        <p>'Batters need to be cautious'
            Kohli, who ended his Test century drought in India's previous meeting with Australia, has urged the Indian batters to be cautious on the neutral turf of The Oval. Sharing his views in a recent interview with Star Sports on Follow the Blues, Kohli opened up about the challenge of batting against Cummins and Co. at the famous venue. “I think The Oval will be challenging, we won’t get a flat wicket and batters need to be cautious. We will need to concentrate on our focus and discipline," Kohli said.</p>

        <p>Harry claims that 140 stories published by MGN papers were the result of phone hacking or other unlawful behavior Prince Harry arrives at the High Court in London, Tuesday, June 6, 2023. Prince Harry is due at a London court to testify against a tabloid publisher he accuses of phone hacking and other unlawful snooping. Harry alleges that journalists at the Daily Mirror and its sister papers used unlawful techniques on an "industrial scale" to get scoops. Publisher Mirror Group Newspapers is contesting the claims.(AP)</p>
        <p>Prince Harry is set to make history as he takes the witness stand at the High Court in London on Tuesday, becoming the first British royal to do so since the 1890s. The trial is part of his lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), publisher of the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror, and the Sunday People tabloids. Let's dive into the details of the trial and the key moments that have unfolded so far:</p>
        <p>Prince Harry, along with over 100 other individuals, is suing MGN for alleged unlawful activities between 1991 and 2011.

        <P>Prince Harry was chosen as one of four test cases for the trial, which commenced on May 10. However, he did not appear in court as expected on Monday, surprising both the judge and MGN's lawyers.</P>

         <h1 id="a8">Court rejects NCB’s plea challenging bail granted to Bharti Singh, husband</h1>
         <img src="./img/8. png.avif">
         <p>Comedian Bharti Singh and her husband Harsh Limbachiyaa did not violate any bail conditions, according to a special NDPS court which rejected the Narcotics Control Bureau's plea to cancel their bail. The couple had been arrested in November 2020 after cannabis was allegedly found at their home and office. The NCB argued that bail had been granted without hearing its counsel, but the court said it was the agency's fault for not appearing at the hearing and there were no grounds to cancel the bail.</p>
         <p>The special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) court last week rejected the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)’s plea, seeking to cancel the bail granted to comedian Bharti Singh and her husband Harsh Limbachiyaa, and said the couple had not violated any of the bail conditions.</p>
         <p>The NCB had on November 21, 2020, arrested Singh and her husband the next day after 86.5 grams of cannabis were allegedly seized during raids at their residence and production house. On November 23, a metropolitan magistrate court had granted them bail. The NCB had on December 31 filed a plea before the special NDPS court challenging the bail</p>
         <p>Special judge VV Patil refused to cancel the couple’s bail. “There are no allegations against the respondents (Singh and Limbachiyaa) of interference with the due course of administration of justice or evasion or attempt to evade the due course of justice or abuse of concession granted to them. There are no allegations of breach of the conditions of the bail order passed by the magistrate court. Therefore, there are absolutely no grounds made out for cancellation of bail to the respondents as prayed by the NCB.”</p>
         <p>The agency contended that the magistrate court had granted bail without hearing the NCB’s counsel. The prosecutor was stuck in a hearing at Thane, and by the time the prosecutor reached the court to submit a reply, objecting to the bail plea, bail had already been granted, the NCB added.</p>

         <p>"We are aware of a US-bound flight that had to make an emergency landing in Russia and are continuing to monitor that situation closely. I'm not able to confirm how many US citizens were aboard the flight at this time," State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters at his daily news conference.</p>
         <p>"It was a flight that was bound for the United States. So, it is, of course, likely that there are American citizens on board. There's public reporting from Air India that they are sending – what my understanding is – a replacement aircraft to the destination to have the passengers carry on for their route, but I would defer to the air carrier to speak to anything further on this," Patel said in response to a question.</p>
